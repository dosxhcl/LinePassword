# LinePassword

This is a LINE x Google Spread Sheet project

When user account gets more and more, people starts to forget their account and password.
If we write it somewhere in the paper. The paper will needs to be carried all the time.
We could save it with the notes app in the PC or Mobile devices. But this is not safe due to the password is not encrpted.
Also search is also a problem when trying to find which account is which.

This project enabled the user to save the account password through the Chatbot(LINE) to Google Spread sheet and the password will be encrypted.
Thus opening the spreadsheet itself won't be able to know what's the password.
Only through the ChatBot(LINE) the password will be decrypted and show up.

The user does not have to find the where the account is recorded since the user only have to type the account they trying to find and the ChatBot will reply the information.
Support LIST command to list out what is record in the spread sheet.
